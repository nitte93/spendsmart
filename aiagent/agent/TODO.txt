Not working > why ?
There are no available records to calculate the average income and average withdrawal for each month.
SELECT STRFTIME('%Y-%m', `transaction_date`) as month, AVG(`withdrawn_amount`) as average_withdrawal, AVG(`deposit_amount`) as average_deposit
FROM `transactions`
WHERE `transaction_date` IS NOT NULL AND `withdrawn_amount` IS NOT NULL AND `deposit_amount` IS NOT NULL AND `transaction_date` != "" AND `withdrawn_amount` != "" AND `deposit_amount` != "" AND `transaction_date` != "N/A" AND `withdrawn_amount` != "N/A" AND `deposit_amount` != "N/A"
GROUP BY month
